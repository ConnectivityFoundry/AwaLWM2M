/**

 * @brief This interface enables an application to be statically embedded within the LWM2M Client and interact with its resources.
 *
 * The Client hosts resources within a data model based on Objects, Object Instances and Resources.
 * Please consult the LWM2M specification for details of this model.
 *
 * A Management Application may interact with the Client via LWM2M, accessing the same resources. Therefore
 * it is essential that both the Client Application and Management Application are aware of the same data
 * model and have definitions for the same objects and resources.
 *
 * It is recommended that OMA registered IDs are used for objects that conform to registered LWM2M objects such
 * as IPSO objects.
