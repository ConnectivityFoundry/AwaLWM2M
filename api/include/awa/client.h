/**
 * @file client.h
 * @brief This interface enables an application to interact with the resources hosted by the LWM2M Client Core.
 *
 * The Core may be running as a separate process (daemon), or it may be linked with the application directly.
 *
 * The Core hosts resources within a data model based on Objects, Object Instances and Resources.
 * Please consult the LWM2M specification for details of this model.
 *
 * A Management Application may interact with the Client via LWM2M, accessing the same resources. Therefore
 * it is essential that both the Client Application and Management Application are aware of the same data
 * model.
 *
 * It is recommended that registered IDs are used for objects that conform to registered LWM2M objects such
 * as IPSO objects.
