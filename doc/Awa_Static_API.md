# The Awa Static API

## Introduction

A constrained device is an IoT node device which is severely limited in terms of power, memory, processing speed and/or connectivity, usually having insufficient resources to safely connect to the internet. A typical example may be something a simple as a remote temperature sensor with strictly defined functionality and a dedicated task. Constrained devices will usually connect to external services via a more powerful gateway device.

The management of constrained devices requires efficient lightweight protocols specifically designed for small code footprint, highly optimised data models and minimal processing requirements. The Open Mobile Alliance's LWM2M, which is built on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained networks, is an ideal management and communication solution for resource limited devices.

## The Awa LightweightM2M client

The Awa LightweightM2M client is a small footprint LWM2M client implementation written in C. Its purpose is to abstract LWM2M functionality while integrating the required data structures with the device's main application code. All Awa LightweightM2M client functionality is accessed via the **Awa Static API**, which provides an interface between a constrained device's application code and LWM2M Client services.

The Awa Static API is ideally suited to devices that have a fixed configuration and dedicated functionality. It provides a concise solution that enables the C data structures in the device application code to be directly accessed by the LWM2M Client.

## Basic LWM2M Client functionality

Device bootstrapping and server registration are performed automatically by the LWM2M Client. Device Object and Resource models are defined on the client side and then registered with the LWM2M management server.

### Device bootstrapping

The device application needs to be pre-configured with bootstrap server credentials. On power up the device contacts the bootstrap server and is provided with alternative credentials suitable for registration with a management server. Management server data is provided as an IPSO server Object. The Awa LightweightM2M client handles the LWM2M bootstrapping process without the need for any application code. All that's required are the bootstrap server details.

*Note that since there is no mechanism in the Static API to verify that the LWM2M management server URL provided by the bootstrap server is correct, the bootstrap server must be trusted.*

### Registration

Device registration with the LWM2M management server is fully abstracted and automated. No supporting application code is needed.

### Device management

Device management is supported by appropriate Object definitions. IPSO Object definitions are supported and custom objects can also be defined.

### Information reporting

The LWM2M Client supports the CoAP *Observe* operation. Observations are handled by the Client, but the application code must first notify the Client if a Resource value has changed.

### Operation

The majority of LWM2M operations happen 'under the hood' of the LWM2M Client. The device application code interacts with the Client via the Static API.

Data are shared between the application code and the LWM2M client using pre-defined or custom Objects and Resources as described in the OMA LWM2M specification. Any server or management application that interacts with the device application must be aware of the client's data model and have definitions for the same Objects and Resources to facilitate interoperability. It is recommended that OMA registered IDs are used that conform to registered LWM2M or IPSO objects.

Since an Object is a container for a set of related Resources, an Object must be defined prior to the Resources associated with it.

Objects and Resources are defined in one of two ways:

* **Pointer Mode** - Objects and Resources are defined in application memory and accessed via pointers which are registered with the LWM2M Client via the Static API.
* **Handler Mode** - Objects and Resources are defined by a handler function. Object and Resource memory cannot be directly accessed by the application code. Resource value operations are passed to the Resource handler for execution and response values are returned by the handler to the application code.

While either of the above modes may be used to manage Objects and Resources, the mode may not be changed once an Object has been defined. For example, Resources which are defined using handler mode cannot then be accessed or modified using pointer mode operations.

#### Summary points for pointer and handler modes

**Pointer Mode**

* Objects are defined as a simple container for resources
* Allows integration of existing C data structures with the LWM2M service
* Application memory is shared and exposed to the Client through pointers registered using the API
* Data access is automatic - LWM2M will read and write memory as required
* Allows for concrete data structures that are laid out in application memory in a static manner
* Works best for existing data structures
* Easier to use than handler mode, but less flexible because data has to be laid out in a static way

**Handler Mode**

* Objects and associated Resources are defined with a handler function
* All Resources defined within a handled object must also be defined with handlers
* Uses callbacks to notify the application of a pending LWM2M operation. Callbacks are responsible for constructing a response
* Memory is not shared. Data access is handled by the application - LWM2M will request operations and the application responds
* Allows for virtual data structures, and data structures that are logically constructed in real time, such as calculating velocity  from change in position over time, and exposing the result as a resource calculated on request
* Works best for resources that require logic or calculations to access
* More involved to use than pointer mode, (more code required), but more flexible because it provides the application with the opportunity to modify values on the fly, effectively offering virtual Resources

### Detailed functionality

#### Sequence of operations

The client side sequence of operations is:

* Initialisation
* definition
* start
* process loop

##### Initialisation

* Include relevant libraries
* Create a new AwaStaticClient
* Name the AwaStaticClient endpoint
* Configure the CoAP address and port
* Provide a bootstrap URI
* Initialise the AwaStaticClient

##### Object and Resource definitions

The definition process sets up pointer and/or handler mode definitions for each LWM2M Object and Resource. The steps required include:

1. Defining an Object which acts as a container for Resources
2. Defining the required Resources that the Object will expose
3. Allocating storage memory for the Resource value using a pointer. This allows the value to be shared by the device's application code.

It's important to remember that Object and Resource definitions are *not instances*. The defined Object must be instantiated before it can be used.

##### Start

This is CoAP initialisation, which allows CoAP endpoints to be created.

##### The process loop

This is where the client-side operations take place such as:

* Bootstrapping and registration
* Creation, deletion, and/or update of Resource values
* Generation of notifications
* LWM2M operations handling

Example code for implementing all of the above functionality can be found [here](http://flowm2m.github.io/AwaLWM2M-docs/examples.html).

#### Object definition

An object is a named container for one or more Resources. To define a new object use *AwaStaticClient_DefineObject* :

````c
AwaError AwaStaticClient_DefineObject(AwaStaticClient * client, AwaObjectID objectID, const char * objectName, uint16_t minimumInstances, uint16_t maximumInstances)
````

*AwaStaticClient_DefineObject* parameters:

* **client** - the AwaStaticClient with which the defined Object is to be associated
* **objectID** - a unique identifier for the Object (may be a custom or IPSO definition)
* **objectName** - a unique object name
* **minimumInstances** - specifies whether an Object is mandatory or optional
  * minimumInstances = 0 : Optional
  * minimumInstances = 1 : Mandatory
* **maximumInstances** - specifies the number of values stored in memory. When a multiple instance Objectis created that was defined using the pointer method, the number of Object instances that exist in that Object will be the *maximumInstances* value used in the Object definition.

#### Resource definition

Resources are defined with properties according to the LWM2M specification, and must be associated with a parent Object. Use *AwaStaticClient_DefineResource* to define a new resource within an existing object:

```c
AwaError AwaStaticClient_DefineResource(AwaStaticClient * client, AwaObjectID objectID, AwaResourceID resourceID, const char * resourceName, AwaResourceType resourceType, uint16_t minimumInstances, uint16_t maximumInstances, AwaResourceOperations operations)
```

*AwaStaticClient_DefineResource* parameters:

* **client** - the AwaStaticClient with which the defined Resource is to be associated
* **objectID** - the identifier of the Resource's parent Object
* **resourceID** - a unique identifier for the Resource
* **resourceName** - a unique name for the Resource
* **resourceType** - the data type for the Resource (integer, float, array, string, boolean, executable...)
* **operations** - the type of operation that may be performed on a Resource *instance* created from this definition (read, write, readWrite, execute)
* **minimumInstances** - specifies whether a Resource is mandatory or optional
  * minimumInstances = 0 : Optional
  * minimumInstances = 1 : Mandatory
* **maximumInstances** - specifies the number of values stored in memory. When a multiple instance Resource is created that was defined using the pointer method, the number of Resource instances that exist in that resource will be the *maximumInstances* value used in the resource definition.

#### Pointer mode

Pointer mode defines Resource Instances in specific memory locations. The specified memory locations may be either *uniform* (of fixed length and contiguous spacing) or *sparse* (fixed length but not contiguous spacing).

##### Uniform resource distribution

Where fixed length resource instances are defined contiguously in memory only the start point and the element size values are required to calculate the location of any resource instance value in the set.

Use the *AwaStaticClient_SetResourceStorageWithPointer* function to specify resource instance values located uniformly in memory as below:

```c
AwaError AwaStaticClient_SetResourceStorageWithPointer(AwaStaticClient * client, AwaObjectID objectID, AwaResourceID resourceID, void * dataPointer, size_t dataElementSize, size_t dataStepSize)
```

This results in fixed length resource instances being distributed continuously in memory as shown below:

![](images/pointer_mode_uniform_resource_distribution.png)

The parameters of the above function used to provide information about the location of each value in memory as shown in the diagram above are:

* **dataPointer** - the value of the start point (dataPointer[0] in the diagram)
* **dataElementSize** - the size of an individual value in bytes
* **dataStepSize** - the number of bytes between values

From the above parameters the location of any array element, dataPointer[N], can be derived. In terms of LWM2M, the element number *N* is the resource instance ID.

##### Sparse resource distribution

In this case, because the resource instance values will not be contiguous or evenly distributed in memory, the location of each value must be explicitly stated as a set of pointer values passed in an array to the *AwaStaticClient_SetResourceStorageWithPointerArray* function.

The prototype for specifying a set of resource instance values that are located sparsely in memory is:

```c
AwaError AwaStaticClient_SetResourceStorageWithPointerArray(AwaStaticClient * client, AwaObjectID objectID, AwaResourceID resourceID, void * dataPointers[], size_t dataElementSize)
```

This results in fixed length resource instances being distributed arbitrarily in memory as shown below:

![](images/pointer_mode_sparse_resource_distribution.png)

The parameters that provide information about the location of each value in memory as shown in the diagram above are:

* **dataPointers** - an array (of size N) of pointers to the values
* **dataElementSize** - the size of an individual value in bytes

##### Opaque resource types in Pointer mode

Opaque resources that are defined in the Pointer mode will always have the length given in the parameter ```dataElementSize``` when operated upon by LWM2M.

For a LWM2M write operation that uses a resource instance length less than ```dataElementSize``` the remaining memory will be zeroed for that resource instance. For a LWM2M read operation the length of the resource instance returned will be ```dataElementSize```.

If opaque resources with variable lengths are required then the Handler mode must be used.

#### Handler mode

Handler mode gives a low level control of both object and resource instances. A generic handler is used for handling LWM2M object and resource operations. Since handler functionality is determined parametrically some handler parameters may or may not be required, depending on the operation.

The prototype for the handler callback function is shown below:

```c
typedef AwaResult(*AwaStaticClientHandler )(AwaStaticClient *client, AwaOperation operation, AwaObjectID objectID, AwaObjectInstanceID objectInstanceID, AwaResourceID resourceID, AwaResourceInstanceID resourceInstanceID, void **dataPointer, size_t *dataSize, bool *changed)
```

The parameters required for handling operations on object and resource instances are described below.
